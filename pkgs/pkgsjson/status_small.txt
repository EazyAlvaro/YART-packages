Description: registers global key bindings for applications - Gtk+3
 keybinder is a library for registering global keyboard shortcuts to be used by
 GTK-based applications under the X Window System.
 .
 When a combination of key is pressed, keybinder notifies it to the registering
 application, which can execute one or more operations based on the event
 previously registered.

 Originally written as part of the Tomboy project, keybinder has been
 distributed as stand-alone library let other applications to use key binding.
 .
 This is the Gtk+3 version of the library.

Description: X C Binding, XKEYBOARD extension
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-xkb, the XKEYBOARD extension for the X C Binding.
 .
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol,
 designed to replace the Xlib interface.  XCB provides several advantages over
 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the library for Avahi's embeddable mDNS/DNS-SD stack.
 This can be used by embedded applications to integrate mDNS/DNS-SD
 functionality into their applications.
 .
 You should not however use this library for non-embedded applications, you
 should use libavahi-client which interacts with the avahi daemon.
